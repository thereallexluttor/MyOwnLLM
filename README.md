# MyOwnLLM

MyOwnLLM is a custom implementation of a language model based on modern techniques in natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning. This project reflects my ability to develop and manage innovative solutions using cutting-edge technologies in the field of language models.

## Inspiration and Technical Foundation

The development of MyOwnLLM has been inspired by the knowledge and examples provided in the book **[Natural Language Processing with Transformers](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/natural-language-processing/9781098136789/)** by Lewis Tunstall, Leandro von Werra, and Thomas Wolf. This book has been a fundamental reference for understanding and applying the power of transformers and Hugging Face tools to real-world problems.

Throughout this project, I have adapted and extended the concepts and techniques presented in the book to create a model tailored to the specific needs of my application.

## Key Features

- **Transformer-Based**: MyOwnLLM leverages the transformer architecture to achieve efficient performance in tasks such as text generation, classification, and question answering.
- **Advanced Customization**: Implements unique adjustments and optimizations to address specific use cases.
- **GPU Execution**: Designed to run on platforms with GPU support, maximizing efficiency in both training and inference.
